Music, though not a central part of my routine, occupies a diverse space within my tastes. 
Rather than adhering to a specific genre, I find myself appreciating a wide spectrum of musical expressions. 
This inclination toward musical variety reflects my openness to exploring the rich tapestry of sounds that span different genres and cultures.
